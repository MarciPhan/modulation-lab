    'modm_qam_desc': "<strong>M-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation):</strong> State of the art technique alternating wave phase and amplitude simultaneously. Essential in high-throughput applications powering modern 5G cellulars, Gigabit Wi-Fi 6 (1024-QAM) down to Digital TV broadcasters. The Chart 2 constellation presents symbols dispersed across a 2D grid matrix. While higher orders transmit more bits iteratively, denser constellation groupings demand immense SNR fidelity raising error odds drastically.",
    'modm_psk_desc': "<strong>M-PSK (Phase Shift Keying):</strong> An approach encoding binary structure exclusively into carrier phase displacements keeping amplitude consistently flat. You can observe symbols aligned perfectly in a circle within the Chart 2 diagram. Immensely popular due to low requirements on amplifier linearity making it the de-facto standard for deep space Satellites, raw GPS signals or baseline reliable communication under bad mobile networks.",
    'modm_ask_desc': "<strong>M-ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying):</strong> Simplest fundamental digital modulation modulating sole carrier voltage magnitude while keeping phase untouched. M=2 directly translates to plain OOK (On/Off Morse). Highly susceptible to atmospheric amplitude noise deterioration yet heavily utilized within legacy cheap infrared optics, doorbells or old gates remotes praising absolute hardware simplicity.",
    'modm_fsk_desc': "<strong>M-FSK (Frequency Shift Keying):</strong> Information jumps amongst diverse frequency pitches rather than varying amplitudes. Chart 4 analysis shows immediate frequency deviations instead of stationary constellations. Yields excellent immunity against amplitude noise attenuations extensively featured in telemetry pipelines, pager communications and classic 433 MHz ISM band telemetry. Audibly, FSK sounds like seamless musical pitch skipping.",
    'modm_css_desc': "<strong>CSS (LoRa Chirp Spread Spectrum):</strong> Semtech disruptive proprietary technique revolutionizing battery-operated \'Internet of Things\'. Foregoes standard static frequencies sending a continuous sweeping \'Chirp\' up or down the band. Modulated messages are staggered via tiny timing phase offsets of those chirps. Astounding receiver capability can dig out signatures deep under the noise floor propagating data tens of kilometers on miniature sensors.",
    'modm_dsss_desc': "<strong>DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum):</strong> Roots tracing to secret military radar tech. One informational bit shatters into dozens of miniature short fragments spread by pseudo-random noise codes. The transmission spreads ultra-wide looking virtually identical to ambient background noise from space rendering enemies clueless. Only receivers applying inverse cipher reconstruct the message above jammers securely. Powers up GPS pinpoint localization and legacy 802.11b Wi-Fis.",
    'modm_fhss_desc': "<strong>FHSS (Frequency Hopping):</strong> Spread spectrum variation conceptualized by Hedy Lamarr defeating WWII torpedo jammers. The communicating endpoints hop across alternating carrier channel slots at insane sync speed following a cryptographic pseudo-string. In case foreign signals jam one channel, the disruption affects mere microsecond fractions before FHSS leaps away. Commonly utilized by Bluetooth shifting 1600 times a second.",
    'modm_thss_desc': "<strong>THSS (Time Hopping Spread Spectrum):</strong> Broadly consists of radiating immensely strong but exceptionally brief sub-nanosecond energy bursts within rigorously computed time windows (slots); maintaining utter radio silence otherwise. Time Hopping allows astonishing quantities of nearby devices sharing identical frequencies simultaneously with collision probability reaching near mathematical zero boundaries. Correlated to UWB (Ultra-Wideband) foundations."
